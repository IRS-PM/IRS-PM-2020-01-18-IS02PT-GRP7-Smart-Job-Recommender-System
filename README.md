## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
With the increasing usage of the internet, recruiters and job seekers alike are turning more towards job search websites such as LinkedIn, JobStreet or MyCareersFuture for job hunting. Users will be provided a list of possible job options based on their search criteria. From there, users have to sort through the list and analyze each job listing to see if they are able to meet the requirements.

This process is very tedious and inefficient due to the amount of workload required from the applicants. In addition, a significant number of job listings included from the search result tend to be completely incompatible with the job seeker, causing them to spend hours finding ones that are suitable.  Thus, a new system to automate most of the manual process would be appealing to job seekers. The system would be able to reduce the overall amount of workload required, and inform them of which jobs are most suitable based on certain criteria.
